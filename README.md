# Saferpay

This is a fork of the original saferpay-gem from whitesmith (http://github.com/whitesmith/saferpay-gem)! We do not take any responsibility for any issues that occur by using this software.

Interact with [Saferpay](http://saferpay.com)'s HTTPS Interface with a ruby API wrapper built with HTTParty.

This gem is based on version 4.6 of Saferpay's Payment Page documentation. You can [contact Saferpay](http://saferpay.com/contact/) to get ahold of your documentation PDF (it doesn't appear to be on their website). Ask for the Payment Page integration documentation.

## Installation
